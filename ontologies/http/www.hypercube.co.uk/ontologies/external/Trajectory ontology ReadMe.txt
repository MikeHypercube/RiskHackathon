Trajectory ontology ReadMe

This version of the external Trajectory ontology has namespaces changed from the original which was in the example.org namespace. 

This was to accommodate the VOM tool which cannot handle ontologies which live directly under a root namespace. 

The original ontology is also included in this repository, in the example.org namespace folder.
